BIO
---

Rickard Armiento received his Ph.D. in theoretical physics in 2005 at
the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Sweden with Prof. Göran
Grimvall as supervisor and Dr. Ann E. Mattsson as co-supervisor. His
work was on the development of improved computational methods for
materials properties. He then received a Humboldt Postdoctoral
Fellowship to join the group of Prof. Stephan Kümmel at the University
of Bayreuth in Germany, where his work was on the computational
description of polarizability. In 2009 he went on a second postdoc in
the group of Prof. Gerbrand Ceder at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) in the USA, where he worked on high-throughput
electronic structure calculations for the design of energy materials.
Since 2012, Dr. Armiento is at Linköping University in Sweden, where he
was appointed Docent in 2015, and associate professor in physical
modeling in June 2017. His current research ranges over
exchange-correlation energy, high-throughput materials design,
properties of graphene, and machine learning for materials properties.
Since 2016 he is also an application expert in big data analytics at the
National Supercomputer Centre at Linköping University.
